# BSP Registry Schema v2.0

This document describes the v2.0 registry YAML schema used by `bsp-registry-tools`.

---

## Overview

Schema v2.0 separates the registry into independent sections:

| Section        | Purpose                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `devices`      | Hardware board/device definitions                             |
| `releases`     | Yocto / Isar release definitions                              |
| `features`     | Optional feature definitions (OTA, secure-boot, …)           |
| `bsp`          | Optional named presets (device + release + features)          |
| `frameworks`   | Optional build-system framework definitions (Yocto, Isar, …) |
| `distro`       | Optional distribution definitions (Poky, Isar distro, …)     |
| `include`      | Optional list of additional registry files to merge in        |

Builds can be driven either by a **named preset** (`bsp build my-preset`) or by
composing components directly (`bsp build --device <d> --release <r>`).

Large registries can be **split across multiple files** using the top-level
`include` directive.  Each included file is merged into the root registry before
the root file's own content is applied.

---

## Top-level Structure

```yaml
specification:
  version: "2.0"          # required

include:                  # optional – list of additional registry files to merge in
  - devices/boards.yaml
  - releases/scarthgap.yaml

environment:              # optional – global environment for all builds
  variables:              # optional – global env vars ($ENV{} expansion supported)
    - name: "DL_DIR"
      value: "$ENV{HOME}/downloads"
  copy:                   # optional – global file copies executed before every build
    - scripts/global-setup.sh: build/

environments:             # optional – named build environments
  default:                # special name: used when release has no environment field
    container: "debian-bookworm"
    variables:
      - name: "DL_DIR"
        value: "$ENV{HOME}/downloads"
    copy:                 # optional – file copies executed for every build using this environment
      - scripts/env-setup.sh: build/

containers:               # optional – Docker container definitions (dict)
  debian-bookworm:
    image: "my-registry/debian/kas:5.1"
    file: Dockerfile
    args:
      - name: "KAS_VERSION"
        value: "5.1"

registry:
  frameworks: [...]       # optional list of build-system framework definitions
  distro: [...]           # optional list of distribution definitions
  devices: [...]          # list of device definitions
  releases: [...]         # list of release definitions
  features: [...]         # list of feature definitions (may be empty)
  bsp: [...]              # optional list of named presets
```

---

## `specification`

```yaml
specification:
  version: "2.0"
```

The tool will exit with a clear error if `version` is not `"2.0"`.

---

## `include` (optional)

The `include` directive splits a registry across multiple YAML files.  It is a
top-level list of paths (relative to the file that contains the directive).
Each referenced file is loaded and merged **before** the current file's content
is applied, so entries in the including file always take precedence.

```yaml
# registry.yaml  ← main file (must contain specification)
specification:
  version: "2.0"

include:
  - devices/boards.yaml      # relative to the directory of this file
  - releases/scarthgap.yaml

registry:
  features: []
  bsp:
    - name: my-bsp
      description: "My BSP"
      device: my-board
      release: scarthgap
      features: []
```

```yaml
# devices/boards.yaml  ← included file (no specification required)
registry:
  devices:
    - slug: my-board
      description: "My Board"
      vendor: acme
      soc_vendor: nxp
      includes:
        - kas/boards/my-board.yaml
  releases: []
  features: []
```

### Merging rules

| Data type | Merge behaviour |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Lists (e.g. `devices`, `releases`, `features`, `environment`) | Concatenated — included items appear **before** the including file's items |
| Dicts (e.g. `containers`, `environments`) | Merged recursively — including file wins on conflicting keys |
| Scalars | Including file wins |

> **Note:** `environment` (global variable list) is a **list** and is
> concatenated.  `environments` (named environment dict) is a **dict** and is
> merged recursively.

### Nested includes

Included files can themselves contain `include` directives.  Paths are always
resolved **relative to the file that contains the directive**.

### Circular include detection

Circular includes are detected at load time.  The tool exits immediately with a
clear error message if the same file is visited twice.

### `specification` in included files

The `specification` block is silently stripped from included files — version
validation is performed only once on the root registry file.

---

## `environment` (optional)

Global build environment applied to every build.  It groups two sub-fields:

| Sub-field   | Type               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `variables` | list[{name,value}] | Environment variables (supports `$ENV{VAR}` expansion against the host shell environment). |
| `copy`      | list[dict]         | File-copy entries executed inside the build environment before every build.  Entries run first, before named-environment and device-level entries. |

```yaml
environment:
  variables:
    - name: "DL_DIR"
      value: "$ENV{HOME}/data/cache/downloads"
    - name: "SSTATE_DIR"
      value: "$ENV{HOME}/data/cache/sstate"
    - name: "GITCONFIG_FILE"
      value: "$ENV{HOME}/.gitconfig"
  copy:
    - scripts/global-setup.sh: build/
    - config/global.conf: build/conf/
```

Both `variables` and `copy` are optional and can be omitted independently.

---

## `containers` (optional)

Docker container definitions used as build environments.  Containers are
referenced from `devices[*].build.container` **or** from
`environments[*].container`.

```yaml
containers:
  debian-bookworm:        # container name / key
    image: "bsp/debian/kas:5.1"   # Docker image (used at runtime)
    file: Dockerfile              # optional: path to Dockerfile for `docker build`
    args:                         # optional: Docker build-args
      - name: "DISTRO"
        value: "debian-bookworm"
      - name: "KAS_VERSION"
        value: "5.1"

  isar-qemu:
    image: "ghcr.io/ilbers/isar:latest"
    file: null
    args: []
    # Optional: extra arguments appended to the container engine `run` command.
    # Passed to kas-container via the KAS_CONTAINER_ARGS environment variable.
    runtime_args: "-p 2222:2222 --device=/dev/net/tun --cap-add=NET_ADMIN"
```

### `containers[*]` fields

| Field           | Type          | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `image`         | string (opt.) | Docker image to use at runtime                                 |
| `file`          | string (opt.) | Path to Dockerfile for `docker build`                          |
| `args`          | list          | Docker build arguments (`name`/`value` pairs)                  |
| `runtime_args`  | string (opt.) | Extra flags appended to the container engine `run` invocation. Forwarded to `kas-container` via `KAS_CONTAINER_ARGS`. Useful for port-forwarding, device access (`--device`), or capability grants (`--cap-add`). |

> The legacy **list** format (`- debian-bookworm: {…}`) is still accepted for
> backward compatibility in the containers section.

---

## `environments` (optional)

Named build environments bundle a **container reference**, optional
**environment variables**, and optional **file-copy entries** together under a
single name.  This makes it easy to associate a specific container image,
variable set, and setup scripts with a particular class of releases (e.g., a
separate Isar container with its own runqemu helper script).

```yaml
environments:
  default:                    # used for any release that does not name an environment
    container: "debian-bookworm"
    variables:
      - name: "DL_DIR"
        value: "$ENV{HOME}/data/cache/downloads"
      - name: "SSTATE_DIR"
        value: "$ENV{HOME}/data/cache/sstate"
    copy:                     # optional: files to copy before builds that use this env
      - scripts/env-setup.sh: build/

  isar-build:                 # named environment for Isar releases
    container: "debian-bookworm-isar"
    variables:
      - name: "DL_DIR"
        value: "$ENV{HOME}/data/cache/isar-downloads"
    copy:
      - isar/scripts/isar-runqemu.sh: build/    # copy helper script into every Isar build dir
```

### `environments[*]` fields

| Field       | Type                 | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `container` | string (opt.)        | Container name (references `containers` section). Used when the device has no container set. |
| `variables` | list (opt.)          | Environment variables merged on top of the root `environment` list.                           |
| `copy`      | list[dict] (opt.)    | File-copy entries executed inside the build environment before every build that uses this environment. The destination is resolved relative to the BSP's build directory (same as `Device.copy`). |

### Resolution rules

1. If `release.environment` is set, the resolver looks up that name in
   `environments`.  If not found, the tool exits with a clear error.
2. If `release.environment` is **not** set, the resolver uses the
   `"default"` named environment (if defined).
3. If no named environment applies, the device's `build.container` (if set)
   and the root `environment` variable list are used as before.

### Container priority

| Source | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| `device.build.container` | **Highest** – explicit device override |
| Named environment container | Used when device has no container set |
| None | No container (bare `kas` run) |

### Variable merging

Named environment variables are merged **on top of** the root-level
`environment` list (root vars first, named-env vars win on conflict).
Feature-level `env` variables are applied last.

### Copy merge order

File-copy entries from all three levels are **concatenated** in the following
order before the build starts:

```
root-level copy → named environment copy → device copy
```

All entries are executed inside the build environment — files are placed in the
build workspace (the project root that is mounted inside the container) so they
are accessible during the build.  Root-level copies always execute first
(shared setup), then environment-specific copies, and finally device-specific
copies.

**Destination path resolution**: the *source* is always resolved relative to
the registry file's parent directory.  The *destination* is resolved relative
to the BSP's build directory.  For example, if the BSP preset's build path is
`build/isar-qemuarm64-ubuntu-noble` and the copy entry specifies `scripts/` as
the destination, the file lands at
`build/isar-qemuarm64-ubuntu-noble/scripts/<filename>`.  This ensures the
copied file is accessible inside the build workspace that is mounted into the
container.  When no preset build path is set (direct `resolve()` call without
a preset) the destination falls back to being relative to the registry
directory.

---

## `registry.frameworks` (optional)

Build-system framework definitions group related distros and enable
framework-level feature compatibility checking via `Feature.compatible_with`.

```yaml
registry:
  frameworks:
    - slug: yocto              # unique identifier (used in distro.framework and compatible_with)
      description: |
        Yocto Project build system
      vendor: "Yocto Project"
      includes:                # optional: KAS files that configure this framework
        - kas/yocto/yocto.yaml

    - slug: isar
      description: |
        Set of scripts for building software packages and repeatable
        generation of Debian-based root filesystems with customizations
      vendor: "Ilbers GmbH"
      includes:
        - kas/isar/isar.yaml
```

### `frameworks[*]` fields

| Field         | Type          | Description                                              |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `slug`        | string        | Unique framework identifier                              |
| `description` | string        | Human-readable description                               |
| `vendor`      | string        | Framework vendor/maintainer name                         |
| `includes`    | list[str]     | Optional KAS configuration files for this framework      |

Distros reference a framework via their `framework` field.  Features use
`compatible_with` to declare which frameworks (or distros) they support.

---

## `registry.distro` (optional)

Distribution / build-system definitions group the KAS configuration files that
set up a particular Linux distribution (e.g. Poky, Isar).  Releases reference
a distro by slug via `Release.distro`, causing the resolver to prepend the
distro's includes before the release includes.

```yaml
registry:
  distro:
    - slug: poky
      description: "Poky (Yocto Project reference distro)"
      vendor: yocto
      framework: yocto         # optional: references frameworks[*].slug
      includes:
        - kas/yocto/distro/poky.yaml

    - slug: poky-harden
      description: "Hardened Poky"
      vendor: yocto
      framework: yocto
      includes:
        - kas/yocto/distro/harden.yaml

    - slug: isar
      description: "Isar v0.11 (Siemens build system)"
      vendor: siemens
      framework: isar
      includes:
        - kas/isar/isar-v0.11.yaml
```

### `distro[*]` fields

| Field         | Type          | Description                                              |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `slug`        | string        | Unique distro identifier                                 |
| `description` | string        | Human-readable description                               |
| `vendor`      | string        | Distro vendor/maintainer name                            |
| `includes`    | list[str]     | KAS configuration files that configure this distro       |
| `framework`   | string (opt.) | Framework slug this distro is based on (references `frameworks[*].slug`). Used for `Feature.compatible_with` checks. |

---

## `registry.devices`

Each device represents a specific hardware board or emulated target.

```yaml
registry:
  devices:
    - slug: imx8mp-adv              # unique identifier (used in CLI / presets)
      description: "Advantech i.MX8M Plus board"
      vendor: advantech             # board vendor
      soc_vendor: nxp               # silicon vendor (used in feature compat checks)
      soc_family: imx8              # optional SoC family
      includes:                     # device-specific KAS configuration files
        - kas/boards/imx8mp-adv.yaml
      local_conf:                   # optional extra local.conf lines
        - "MACHINE_EXTRA_RDEPENDS += 'kernel-modules'"
      copy:                         # optional files to copy before the build
        - scripts/setup.sh: build/imx8mp-adv/

    - slug: qemuarm64
      description: "QEMU ARM64 (emulated)"
      vendor: qemu
      soc_vendor: arm
      includes:
        - kas/qemu/qemuarm64.yaml
```

### `devices[*]` fields

| Field        | Type                 | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `slug`       | string               | Unique device identifier (referenced by presets and CLI)                    |
| `description`| string               | Human-readable description                                                  |
| `vendor`     | string               | Board vendor name (used for vendor-specific release includes and feature compatibility checks) |
| `soc_vendor` | string               | Silicon vendor name (used in feature compatibility checks)                  |
| `soc_family` | string (opt.)        | SoC family identifier (used in feature compatibility checks)                |
| `includes`   | list[str]            | Device-specific KAS configuration files                                     |
| `local_conf` | list[str]            | Lines appended to `local.conf` for this device                              |
| `copy`       | list[dict[str, str]] | Files to copy into the build environment before the build starts. Each entry is a single-key dict `{"source": "destination"}`. The source is resolved relative to the registry file's parent directory. The destination is resolved relative to the BSP's build directory, so `scripts/` means a `scripts/` subdirectory *inside* the BSP output folder (e.g. `build/my-bsp/scripts/`). If the destination ends with `/` or is an existing directory, the source filename is preserved. |

> **Note on build output path and container:** In v2.0 the container and output path are **optional** preset-level overrides configured in the preset's `build:` block (see [`registry.bsp`](#registrybsp-optional-presets) below).  When `build:` is absent, or when individual fields are omitted, the container falls back to the release's named environment (or `"default"`), and the path is auto-composed as `build/<distro>-<device>-<release>`.  New registries should use the flat `includes`/`local_conf`/`copy` fields directly on the device instead of the legacy `device.build:` nested block.

---

## `registry.releases`

Releases define Yocto / Isar base configurations shared across multiple devices.

```yaml
registry:
  releases:
    - slug: scarthgap                # unique identifier
      description: "Yocto 5.0 LTS (Scarthgap)"
      yocto_version: "5.0"           # optional Yocto version string
      isar_version: null             # optional Isar version string
      # environment: default         # optional – name of the environment to use
      distro: poky                   # optional – references distro[*].slug
      includes:                      # base KAS files for this release
        - kas/scarthgap.yaml
      vendor_includes:               # optional vendor-specific overrides
        - vendor: advantech
          includes:
            - kas/advantech/scarthgap-vendor.yaml

    - slug: isar-v0.11
      description: "Isar v0.11"
      environment: isar-build        # use the 'isar-build' named environment
      distro: isar
      includes:
        - kas/isar/v0.11.yaml
```

The optional `environment` field names an entry from the top-level
`environments` dict.  When omitted, the `"default"` named environment is
used (if defined).  See [Named environments](#environments-optional) for
full resolution rules.

The optional `distro` field references a `registry.distro` entry.  When set
the resolver prepends the distro's includes before the release includes and uses
the distro's `framework` for `Feature.compatible_with` checks.

### `releases[*].vendor_includes`

When a device's `vendor` matches a `vendor_includes` entry, those additional KAS
files are added **after** the base release includes.

> **Note:** In v2.0, `vendor_includes` is stored in the registry for informational
> purposes.  The resolver uses `device.vendor` to select relevant vendor overrides
> automatically (this is on the roadmap for a future resolver improvement).

---

## `registry.features`

Features are optional add-ons (OTA update, secure boot, …) that can be enabled
per-build.  Each feature can declare device compatibility constraints
(`compatibility`) and/or framework/distro restrictions (`compatible_with`).

```yaml
registry:
  features:
    - slug: ota                      # unique identifier
      description: "Over-the-Air Update support via SWUpdate"
      includes:                      # feature-specific KAS files
        - kas/features/ota.yaml
      local_conf:                    # lines appended to local.conf
        - "DISTRO_FEATURES:append = ' swupdate'"
      env: []                        # feature-specific env vars (optional)
      # No compatibility block = works with ALL devices
      # No compatible_with = works with ALL frameworks/distros

    - slug: secure-boot
      description: "Secure Boot (NXP HABv4 / AHAB)"
      compatibility:
        soc_vendor:                  # empty list = all; non-empty = allow-list
          - nxp
      includes:
        - kas/features/secure-boot.yaml
      env:
        - name: "SIGNING_KEY"
          value: "$ENV{SIGNING_KEY}"

    - slug: isar-users
      description: "Add sample non-root user accounts (Isar only)"
      compatible_with: [isar]        # only compatible with the Isar framework
      includes:
        - kas/isar/features/users.yaml

    - slug: yocto-systemd
      description: "Enable systemd as the init system (Yocto only)"
      compatible_with: [yocto]       # only compatible with the Yocto framework
      includes:
        - kas/yocto/features/systemd.yaml
```

### Device compatibility rules (`compatibility`)

| `compatibility` key | Meaning                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `vendor`            | Allow-list of board vendor names (empty = all)    |
| `soc_vendor`        | Allow-list of SoC vendor names (empty = all)      |
| `soc_family`        | Allow-list of SoC family strings (empty = all)    |

If any constraint fails, the build exits with a clear error message.

### Framework/distro compatibility (`compatible_with`)

The `compatible_with` field is an optional list of framework slugs and/or
distro slugs.  When non-empty the resolver checks that the release's distro
or its framework appears in the list before allowing the feature.

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `compatible_with` is empty | Feature is compatible with all releases |
| Release's distro slug is in `compatible_with` | Compatible |
| Release's distro's `framework` slug is in `compatible_with` | Compatible |
| Neither the distro nor its framework is in the list | Build exits with error |
| `compatible_with` is set but the release has no distro | Build exits with error |

## `registry.bsp` (optional presets)

Named presets are convenience shortcuts for a device + release + features
combination.  They are optional — builds can also be triggered by passing
`--device`/`--release` flags directly on the CLI.

### Single-release preset

```yaml
registry:
  bsp:
    - name: imx8mp-adv-scarthgap     # unique preset name
      description: "Advantech i.MX8MP Scarthgap baseline"
      device: imx8mp-adv             # references devices[*].slug
      release: scarthgap             # references releases[*].slug
      features: []                   # optional list of feature slugs
                                     # no build: block → container from named environment;
                                     # path auto-composed as build/<distro>-<device>-<release>

    - name: imx8mp-adv-scarthgap-ota
      description: "Advantech i.MX8MP Scarthgap with OTA"
      device: imx8mp-adv
      release: scarthgap
      features:
        - ota
      build:                          # optional – override container and/or output path
        container: "debian-bookworm"  # optional container override (from containers section)
        path: build/imx8mp-adv-scarthgap-ota  # optional path override; auto-composed if absent
```

### Multi-release preset (simplified syntax)

When the same device and feature set should target several releases, use the
`releases` (plural) list instead of repeating the entry:

```yaml
registry:
  bsp:
    # This single entry expands into:
    #   imx8mp-adv-scarthgap  →  build/poky-imx8mp-adv-scarthgap
    #   imx8mp-adv-styhead    →  build/poky-imx8mp-adv-styhead
    - name: imx8mp-adv
      description: "Advantech i.MX8MP baseline"
      device: imx8mp-adv
      releases: [scarthgap, styhead]   # expands into one preset per release slug
      features: []
      build:
        container: "debian-bookworm"   # container override is preserved per expansion;
                                       # build path is always auto-composed
```

> **Note**: `release` (singular) and `releases` (plural) are mutually exclusive.
> Exactly one must be specified per preset entry.  When `releases` is used the
> expanded preset names follow the pattern `{name}-{release_slug}`.

### `bsp[*]` fields

| Field         | Type          | Description                                                                     |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | string        | Unique preset name (referenced by CLI `bsp build <name>`)                       |
| `description` | string        | Human-readable description                                                      |
| `device`      | string        | Device slug (references `devices[*].slug`)                                      |
| `release`     | string (opt.) | Single release slug (mutually exclusive with `releases`)                        |
| `releases`    | list[str] (opt.) | List of release slugs; expanded into one preset per entry (mutually exclusive with `release`) |
| `features`    | list[str]     | Optional list of feature slugs to enable (references `features[*].slug`)        |
| `build`       | object (opt.) | Optional build overrides (container and/or output path)                         |

### `bsp[*].build` fields

| Field       | Type          | Description                                                                       |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `container` | string (opt.) | Container name override (key in `containers` section). When absent the container is taken from the release's named environment (or `"default"`). |
| `path`      | string (opt.) | Build output directory. When absent the path is auto-composed as `build/<distro>-<device>-<release>[-<feature>…]`. Ignored when `releases` (plural) is used — the path is always auto-composed for expanded presets. |

### KAS file ordering

The resolver assembles the final KAS file list in the following order:

```
framework.includes → distro.includes → release.includes → device.includes → feature.includes
```

This ensures that base build-system configuration (framework) is loaded first, followed
by distribution defaults, then release-specific settings, device-specific machine config,
and finally any optional feature additions.

[`include` section](#include-optional) above for how to split it across multiple
files.
